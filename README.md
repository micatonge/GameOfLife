# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state. Players interact with the game by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

This project implements Conway's Game of Life using React, Typescript, and Chakra UI.
